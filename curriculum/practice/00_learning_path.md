Mapping: Curriculum → Canonical problems
- `01_schema_and_ddl.sql` → schema design tasks in problems

- `08_indexing_and_performance.sql` → performance tuning for your solved problems

Mock interview checklist (30–45 minute problem):
1. Read problem carefully; restate it in one sentence.
2. Ask clarifying questions (expected nulls, duplicates, desired sort order, DB flavor).
3. Propose a sample dataset and expected output.
4. Outline approach with pseudocode/steps (1–3 lines).
5. Write the query; handle edge cases (NULLs, ties, empty sets).
6. Explain complexity and possible optimizations (indexes, rewriting with joins/CTE, limits).
7. Run through a small example to verify correctness.

Common interview tips & pitfalls:
- Always consider NULLs and duplicates explicitly.
- Be ready to explain why you chose a window function vs aggregation/join.
- Time complexity: be able to identify scans vs index seeks conceptually.
- If asked to optimize, propose concrete index(s) and explain why (covering index, column order).
- For recursive/graph problems, clarify termination conditions and performance concerns.

Resources (recommended):
- SQLBolt — interactive tutorials
- Mode SQL Tutorials — applied data analysis examples
- LeetCode / HackerRank SQL problems — timed practice
