## 🛠️ Setup for Practice

### 1. Choose Your Database
```bash
cd syntax/mysql/          # MySQL (most common)
# or cd syntax/postgresql/ # PostgreSQL (advanced features)
# or cd syntax/sql-server/ # SQL Server (enterprise)
```

### 2. Install and Setup
```bash
cat README.md             # Installation instructions
./examples/load_sample_data.sh -u username -p password -d database
```

### 3. Start Practicing
```bash
cd interview-prep/        # For structured interview prep
cat README.md            # Get your 30-day practice roadmap
ls -la */                # See problems organized by difficulty
cd easy/                # Start with basic problems
ls *.md                 # Choose your first problem
```
